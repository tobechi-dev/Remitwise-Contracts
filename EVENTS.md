# Remitwise Contracts Event Schema Documentation

This document defines the complete event schema for all Remitwise smart contracts. Events are emitted on-chain and can be indexed by external systems (indexers, frontends, analytics platforms) for reliable data parsing and monitoring.

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Compatibility:** Soroban SDK v21+

## Event Architecture

### Event Publishing Pattern

All Remitwise contracts use Soroban's `env.events().publish()` mechanism with a consistent topic structure:

```rust
// Primary event (indexed by topic)
env.events().publish((topic_symbol,), event_data);

// Secondary event (for categorization)
env.events().publish((contract_name, event_category), event_data);
```

### Data Types

- **Address**: Soroban Address type (32 bytes)
- **Symbol**: Short symbol (up to 12 characters, encoded as u64)
- **i128**: Signed 128-bit integer (stroops for amounts)
- **u32**: Unsigned 32-bit integer (IDs, counts)
- **u64**: Unsigned 64-bit integer (timestamps, dates)
- **String**: UTF-8 encoded string
- **bool**: Boolean flag

### Timestamp Convention

All timestamps are in **Unix epoch seconds** (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).

    pub amount: i128,               // Amount in stroops
    pub due_date: u64,              // Unix timestamp of due date
    pub recurring: bool,            // Whether bill recurs
    pub frequency_days: u32,        // Recurrence frequency in days (0 if non-recurring)

### Event: Report Stored

**Topic:** `("reporting", ReportEvent::ReportStored)`

**Data Structure:**
```rust
pub struct ReportStoredEvent {
    pub user: Address,              // User address
    pub report_type: Symbol,        // Report type
    pub period_key: u64,            // Period identifier
    pub stored_at: u64,             // Storage timestamp
}
```

### Event: Addresses Configured

**Topic:** `("reporting", ReportEvent::AddressesConfigured)`

**Data Structure:**
```rust
pub struct AddressesConfiguredEvent {
    pub configured_by: Address,     // Address that configured
    pub timestamp: u64,             // Event timestamp
}
```

### Event: Reports Archived

**Topic:** `("reporting", ReportEvent::ReportsArchived)`

**Data Structure:**
```rust
pub struct ReportsArchivedEvent {
    pub count: u32,                 // Number of reports archived
    pub archived_at: u64,           // Archive timestamp
}
```

## Version Compatibility

### Contract Versioning

Each contract maintains a version number that can be queried via `get_version()`. Version changes are emitted as upgrade events.

**Current Versions:**
- Bill Payments: v1
- Savings Goals: v1
- Insurance: v1
- Remittance Split: v1
- Family Wallet: v1
- Orchestrator: v1
- Reporting: v1

### Event Format Stability

**Backward Compatibility Guarantees:**
- Event topics (primary and secondary) are immutable
- Event data structures are append-only (new fields added at the end)
- Existing fields maintain their type and position
- Deprecated fields are marked but not removed

**Breaking Changes:**
- Major version bumps indicate potential event schema changes
- Indexers should monitor `upgraded` events for version changes
- Contract upgrades are announced via `set_version()` calls

### Migration Path

When upgrading contracts:
1. New event types are added with new topic symbols
2. Old event types continue to be emitted for backward compatibility
3. Indexers can subscribe to both old and new topics during transition period
4. After deprecation period, old events may be phased out (announced in advance)

## Indexer Integration Guide

### Recommended Indexing Strategy

1. **Subscribe to all contract topics:**
   ```
   "Remitwise", "savings", "insure", "split", "family", "orchestrator", "reporting"
   ```

2. **Parse events by topic structure:**
   - Primary topic: Main event type
   - Secondary topics: Category and priority information
   - Data: Strongly-typed event payload

3. **Handle optional fields:**
   - Use `null` for missing optional values
   - Validate presence before processing

4. **Monitor version events:**
   - Track `upgraded` events to detect schema changes
   - Update parsers when new versions are detected

### Example Event Parsing (Pseudocode)

```javascript
function parseEvent(topics, data) {
  const [primary, ...secondary] = topics;
  
  switch(primary) {
    case "Remitwise":
      return parseBillPaymentEvent(secondary, data);
    case "savings":
      return parseSavingsEvent(secondary, data);
    case "insure":
      return parseInsuranceEvent(secondary, data);
    case "split":
      return parseSplitEvent(secondary, data);
    // ... other contracts
  }
}
```

## FAQ

**Q: Why are there both primary and secondary topics?**  
A: Primary topics enable efficient filtering by event type. Secondary topics provide categorization for analytics and monitoring.

**Q: How do I handle optional fields in events?**  
A: Optional fields are represented as `null` in JSON. Check for null before accessing.

**Q: What happens if a contract is upgraded?**  
A: An `upgraded` event is emitted with the old and new version numbers. Indexers should monitor these events.

**Q: Are events immutable?**  
A: Yes. Once emitted, events are immutable on-chain. They cannot be modified or deleted.

**Q: How do I correlate events across contracts?**  
A: Use the `caller` or `owner` address field to trace operations across contracts. The orchestrator contract emits flow events that reference multiple sub-contracts.
