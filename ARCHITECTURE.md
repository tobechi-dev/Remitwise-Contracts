# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Remitwise Contracts suite implements a comprehensive financial management system on the Stellar network using Soroban smart contracts. The architecture follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns and integrated data flow.

## Integration Patterns

### Automated Remittance Processing

```rust
fn process_remittance(env: Env, user: Address, amount: i128) {
    // 1. Calculate allocations
    let allocations = remittance_split::calculate_split(env, amount);

    // 2. Allocate to savings
    savings_goals::add_to_goal(env, user, primary_goal, allocations[1]);

    // 3. Create bill payments
    bill_payments::create_bill(env, user, "Monthly Bills", allocations[2], due_date, false, 0, None);

    // 4. Pay insurance premiums
    insurance::pay_premium(env, user, active_policy);
}
```

### Cross-Contract Queries

```rust
fn get_financial_overview(env: Env, user: Address) -> FinancialOverview {
    let unpaid_bills = bill_payments::get_total_unpaid(env, user);
    let monthly_premium = insurance::get_total_monthly_premium(env, user);
    let savings_goals = savings_goals::get_all_goals(env, user);
    let split_config = remittance_split::get_config(env);

    FinancialOverview {
        unpaid_bills,
        monthly_premium,
        savings_goals,
        split_config,
    }
}
```

### Reporting Integration

The Reporting contract aggregates data from all contracts:

```rust
fn generate_financial_health_report(env: Env, user: Address) -> FinancialHealthReport {
    // Query remittance split configuration
    let split_client = RemittanceSplitClient::new(&env, &split_address);
    let split_config = split_client.get_split(&env);

    // Query savings progress
    let savings_client = SavingsGoalsClient::new(&env, &savings_address);
    let goals = savings_client.get_all_goals(user.clone());

    // Query bill compliance
    let bill_client = BillPaymentsClient::new(&env, &bills_address);
    let unpaid_bills = bill_client.get_unpaid_bills(user.clone());

    // Query insurance coverage
    let insurance_client = InsuranceClient::new(&env, &insurance_address);
    let policies = insurance_client.get_active_policies(user);

    // Calculate health score and generate report
    calculate_health_score_and_report(split_config, goals, unpaid_bills, policies)
}
```

## Security Architecture

### Access Control

- **Owner Authorization:** All operations require owner signature
- **Contract Isolation:** Each user has isolated data
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive parameter validation
- **State Consistency:** Atomic operations prevent inconsistent states

### Storage Security

- **TTL Management:** Automatic storage cleanup
- **Instance Storage:** Efficient data organization
- **Event Logging:** Complete audit trail
- **Panic Handling:** Fail-fast on invalid operations

## Event Architecture

### Event Naming Conventions

All event topics and storage keys follow standardized naming conventions documented in:

- **Full Conventions**: [`docs/naming-conventions.md`](docs/naming-conventions.md)
- **Quick Reference**: [`docs/naming-quick-reference.md`](docs/naming-quick-reference.md)
- **Audit & Action Plan**: [`docs/naming-audit-action-plan.md`](docs/naming-audit-action-plan.md)

**Key Principles**:

- Event topics: lowercase, max 8 characters, past tense for actions
- Storage keys: UPPERCASE, underscores for multi-word, max 8 characters
- Event enums: PascalCase, descriptive names

### Event Types

```
Bill Payments Events:
├── Namespace: "bills"
├── BillEvent::Created
├── BillEvent::Paid
├── BillEvent::ExternalRefUpdated

Insurance Events:
├── Namespace: "insure"
├── InsuranceEvent::PolicyCreated
├── InsuranceEvent::PremiumPaid
├── InsuranceEvent::PolicyDeactivated
├── InsuranceEvent::ExternalRefUpdated

Remittance Split Events:
├── Namespace: "split"
├── SplitEvent::Initialized
├── SplitEvent::Updated
├── SplitEvent::Calculated

Savings Goals Events:
├── Namespace: "savings"
├── SavingsEvent::GoalCreated
├── SavingsEvent::FundsAdded
├── SavingsEvent::FundsWithdrawn
├── SavingsEvent::GoalCompleted
├── SavingsEvent::GoalLocked
├── SavingsEvent::GoalUnlocked

Reporting Events:
├── Namespace: "report"
├── ReportEvent::ReportGenerated
├── ReportEvent::ReportStored
├── ReportEvent::AddressesConfigured
```

### Event Flow

```
User Action → Contract Function → State Change → Event Emission → Off-chain Processing
```

### Event Publication Pattern

```rust
// Standard pattern used across all contracts
env.events().publish(
    (symbol_short!("<namespace>"), EventEnum::Variant),
    event_data
);

// Example from Savings Goals
env.events().publish(
    (symbol_short!("savings"), SavingsEvent::GoalCreated),
    (goal_id, owner)
);
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Storage Optimization

- **Instance Storage:** Used for frequently accessed data
- **TTL Extension:** Prevents storage bloat
- **Efficient Maps:** O(1) access patterns
- **Minimal Data Duplication:** Shared storage keys
- **Tiered TTL Strategy:** Active data (~30 days), archived data (~180 days)
- **Data Archival:** Completed/inactive records moved to compressed archive storage
- **Bulk Cleanup:** Functions to permanently delete old archives
- **Storage Monitoring:** `StorageStats` struct tracks active/archived counts in all contracts

### Data Archival System

Each contract implements a comprehensive archival system:

```
Active Storage                    Archive Storage
├── GOALS (Map<u32, SavingsGoal>)  → ARCH_GOAL (Map<u32, ArchivedGoal>)
├── BILLS (Map<u32, Bill>)         → ARCH_BILL (Map<u32, ArchivedBill>)
├── POLICIES (Map<u32, Policy>)    → ARCH_POL (Map<u32, ArchivedPolicy>)
├── PEND_TXS (Map<u64, PendingTx>) → ARCH_TX (Map<u64, ArchivedTransaction>)
└── REPORTS (Map<(Addr,u64), Rpt>) → ARCH_RPT (Map<(Addr,u64), ArchivedReport>)
```

**Archival Flow:**

1. Archive functions move completed/inactive records to archive storage
2. Archived records use compressed structs with essential fields only
3. Archive storage uses longer TTL (6 months) for cost efficiency
4. Cleanup functions permanently delete old archives when no longer needed
5. Restore functions can move archived records back to active storage

**Archived Data Compression:**

- `ArchivedGoal`: Removes `locked`, `target_date` (no longer relevant)
- `ArchivedBill`: Removes `due_date`, `recurring`, `frequency_days`, `created_at`
- `ArchivedPolicy`: Removes `monthly_premium`, `coverage_amount`, `next_payment_date`
- `ArchivedTransaction`: Stores only `tx_id`, `tx_type`, `proposer`, timestamps
- `ArchivedReport`: Stores only `user`, `period_key`, `health_score`, timestamps

### Performance Patterns

- **Batch Operations:** Minimize cross-contract calls
- **Caching:** Client-side caching of configurations
- **Pagination:** For large result sets
- **Async Processing:** Event-driven architecture

## Operational Limits and Monitoring

### `u32` ID Usage and Overflow Analysis

Contracts using monotonic `u32` IDs:

- `bill_payments`: `BILLS` map + `NEXT_ID`
- `insurance`: `POLICIES` map + `NEXT_ID`
- `savings_goals`: `GOALS` map + `NEXT_ID`

Current create paths use `NEXT_ID + 1`. At `u32::MAX` (`4,294,967,295`), the next create attempt overflows and reverts.

Overflow behavior rationale:

- Repository release profile sets `overflow-checks = true` in root `Cargo.toml`.
- With overflow checks enabled, increment overflow traps/reverts rather than silently wrapping.
- Operationally, this is safer than wraparound, but still creates a hard stop for new records once max ID is reached.

### Practical Count Limits (Recommended)

Although `u32` allows billions of IDs, practical limits are much lower because several read methods scan `1..=NEXT_ID`:

- `bill_payments`: `get_unpaid_bills`, `get_overdue_bills`, `get_all_bills`
- `insurance`: `get_active_policies`
- `savings_goals`: `get_all_goals`

Recommended operational caps:

| Contract          |   Per-user recommended max | Per-contract recommended max (`NEXT_ID`) | Rationale                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------: | ---------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bill_payments`   |          2,000 bills/owner |                                   20,000 | Multiple scan-heavy reads; canceled bills leave ID gaps so scan cost still tracks `NEXT_ID`. |
| `insurance`       |         500 policies/owner |                                   15,000 | Active-policy queries scan full ID range; deactivated policies still consume IDs.            |
| `savings_goals`   |          1,000 goals/owner |                                   20,000 | Owner list path scans full ID range.                                                         |
| `family_wallet`\* | 50 members, 500 pending tx |                       N/A (`u64` tx IDs) | Numeric overflow is not a practical concern; cap to control operational complexity.          |

\* `family_wallet` transaction IDs are `u64` (`NEXT_TX`), not `u32`.

### Monitoring Recommendations

Track per deployed contract:

1. `NEXT_ID` value and growth rate.
2. `NEXT_ID` vs active records (gap ratio), especially where cancellations/removals exist.
3. Per-owner record distribution (top-N owners) from off-chain indexing.
4. Failure/latency trends for scan-heavy read methods.
5. Create-path revert rates, especially near caps.

Alert thresholds:

- Warning: 70% of recommended contract max.
- Critical: 90% of recommended contract max.
- Absolute overflow safety warning: `NEXT_ID >= 3,500,000,000`.

### Operational Response When Limits Are Approaching

1. Apply off-chain admission control for new creates (global and per-owner caps).
2. Route new records to a fresh deployment shard before query performance degrades.
3. Prioritize migration of highest-volume owners.
4. Plan API/storage evolution (pagination and owner-indexed iteration) before raising caps.

## Error Handling

### Error Propagation

```
Contract Function
    ├── Success → Return Result
    ├── Validation Error → Panic with message
    ├── Access Error → Panic with message
    └── Storage Error → Panic with message
```

### Standardized Error Codes (issue #336)

All contracts use `#[contracterror]` enums with sequential integer codes starting at 1. This enables
consistent error handling for indexers, frontends, and cross-contract calls.

#### InsuranceError

## Testing Architecture

### Unit Tests

Each contract includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

- Happy path scenarios
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- Integration scenarios

### Integration Tests

Cross-contract functionality testing:

- Remittance processing workflows
- Multi-contract state consistency
- Event emission verification
- Access control validation

## Deployment Architecture

### Network Deployment

```
Development → Testnet → Mainnet
     │           │         │
     ├── Unit Tests       │
     └── Integration Tests└── Production Monitoring
```

### Contract Dependencies

```
Remittance Split ← Bill Payments
Remittance Split ← Insurance
Remittance Split ← Savings Goals
All Contracts ← Reporting (read-only queries)
```

No circular dependencies ensure clean deployment order. The Reporting contract should be deployed last after all other contracts are deployed and their addresses are known.
