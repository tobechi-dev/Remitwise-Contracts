# Access Control Matrix - Remitwise Contracts

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive access-control matrix mapping each public method across all contracts to its required caller (owner/admin/anyone/other contract). It also identifies risky functions requiring tighter controls and documents cross-contract call constraints.

### Cross-Contract Call Constraints

The orchestrator makes the following cross-contract calls:

1. **Family Wallet** (`check_spending_limit`)
   - Validates caller has permission
   - Checks spending limit

2. **Remittance Split** (`calculate_split`)
   - Gets allocation amounts
   - No auth required on called contract

3. **Savings Goals** (`add_to_goal`)
   - Deposits to goal
   - Requires caller to be goal owner

4. **Bill Payments** (`pay_bill`)
   - Pays bill
   - Requires caller to be bill owner

5. **Insurance** (`pay_premium`)
   - Pays premium
   - Requires caller to be policy owner

### Risky Functions - Orchestrator
- **`execute_remittance_flow`**: Executes multiple operations atomically. If any step fails, all revert.
- **`execute_savings_deposit` / `execute_bill_payment` / `execute_insurance_payment`**: Individual operations that check permissions but execute immediately.

## Summary of Improvements Needed

Based on the access control analysis, the following improvements are recommended:

### High Priority

1. **Family Wallet - Emergency Transfer Bypass**
   - **Issue**: `propose_emergency_transfer` can bypass multisig when emergency mode is enabled
   - **Recommendation**: Add a configurable limit on emergency transfers even in emergency mode

2. **Remittance Split - Missing Nonce Validation**
   - **Issue**: `calculate_split` has no access control - anyone can calculate splits
   - **Recommendation**: Consider adding optional owner-only calculation for sensitive amounts

3. **Bill Payments - Admin Access to All Bills**
   - **Issue**: `get_all_bills` exposes all bills to admin
   - **Recommendation**: Consider limiting to audit purposes only with event logging

### Medium Priority

4. **Batch Operations Lack Confirmation**
   - **Issue**: `batch_pay_bills`, `batch_add_to_goals` execute multiple operations
   - **Recommendation**: Add optional confirmation for large batch sizes

5. **Snapshot Import Overwrites All Data**
   - **Issue**: `import_snapshot` in Savings Goals and Remittance Split can replace all data
   - **Recommendation**: Require multi-sig or time-lock for snapshot imports

6. **No Rate Limiting on Critical Functions**
   - **Issue**: No rate limiting on functions like `pay_bill`, `withdraw`
   - **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting for high-frequency operations

### Low Priority

7. **Role Expiry Not Enforced Consistently**
   - **Issue**: `set_role_expiry` exists but not all functions check expiry
   - **Recommendation**: Audit all functions to ensure role expiry is checked

8. **Pause Functions Could Be More Granular**
   - **Issue**: Function-level pause exists but not consistently applied
   - **Recommendation**: Review all contracts for consistent function-level pause

---

## Appendix: Role Hierarchy

| Role | Numeric Value | Privileges |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Owner | 1 | Full control, can add/remove admins, can pause |
| Admin | 2 | Can manage members, configure settings |
| Member | 3 | Can propose/sign transactions |
| Viewer | 4 | Read-only access |
